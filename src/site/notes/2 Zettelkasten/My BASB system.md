# My BASB system

## The System

- Projects
	- Relevant now, want to finish, specific outcome, set finish date to impose some urgency
	- MoC - links to permanent notes mostly (Zettelkasten)

- Areas
	- All the learning, ideas, understanding and in general relevant knowledge
	- Both topic base or without
	- MoC - links to permanent notes mostly (Zettelkasten)

- Zettelkasten
	- Permanent notes
	- [[Atomic notes\|Atomic notes]]
	- If broad topic - mention idea and link and write in a separate note
	- References - source, keywords, linked notes

- Inbox
	- Daily notes - all thought, idea, reference, anything writable by default first go here
	- Literature notes
	- Reference notes
	- Fleeting notes

- Resources
	- quotes, article snippets, audio/video links, books refs

- Archive
	- past projects, thoughts, knowledge, ideas, reference or anything not relevant or pursuable goes here

- Files
	- all the files used in all notes

- Templates
	- Obsidian template for convenience and structure


Zettelkasten system - my version

- Literature notes + Reference notes -> Inbox
- Permanent Notes -> Zettelkasten
- Hub -> MOC (Projects + Areas)
- Fleeting Notes -> Daily Notes + Inbox
	- All random thoughts, ideas go into daily notes, before the end of the day all entry is reviewed, refined and worthy ones turned into permanent notes.


## The Process

Luhmann Process
- Read
- Write
- Review
- Relate
- Create
